# hs_corelang_parser

This is a parser for the Core language described in chapter 1 of the book *Implementing Functional Languages: a tutorial* by Simon L. Peyton Jones and David R. Lester.

The parser itself is based on Monadic Parsing as described in *Programming in Haskell* by Graham Hutton.

This project was realized for a course in Functional Languages at the University of Padua.
